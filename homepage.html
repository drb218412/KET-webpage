The Kiddie Express Train is a trackless train loved by kids and adults alike. Our steam engine train replica can accomodate up to 18 small people. The train comes complete with a bell, a horn, an engine that puffs smoke, a driver and conductor in appropriate engineer clothing and gear. We work festivals, birthday parties, school functions, church or corporate events by the hour or by the day. We also offer multiple-hour discount packages.
