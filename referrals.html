		<q>I thought you were great! You were friendly and professional and punctual! I will definitely call you next year. The children loved your train and your excellent service was noticed by the adults.</q>-MJ</p>

		<q>My son is still talking about the choo-choo train that came to visit, a month, later, and he&#39;s only 3! What a lasting impression you made on him (and his friends and family)</q>-GB</p>

		<q>Kiddie Express is an awesome company. My 2 year-old son and his friends talked about the experience for months afterwards (my son just mentioned it last week). The owners were very prompt and friendly and took great pains to make sure the children were safe at all times. I would give them 5 stars overall! I&#39;m considering having a train theme again next year, just for the convenience. Parents who attended had the option of going with their child(ren) or staying back and having adult conversation with each other. It was also very relaxing for me the hostess.</q>-TH</p>

		<q>Not only did the children have a really great time, but so did the adults. My children are still thanking me and talking about how they had a train at their birthday party. This was a wonderful experience. I hope to be able to do it again sometime.</q>-SM</p>

		<q>You guys were great! Everyone loved it! The train was adorable and very realistic (with the smoke and fake coal!) People couldn&#39;t stop talking about it. The two people helping out were very kind and professional.</q>-TB</p>

		<q>Your train is above and beyond excellent. I was extremely impressed with the safety codes you used, the appearance of your team and above all the kindness you showed to the children. My son had a wonderful time and I know this will be one memory he will treasure. I will certainly recommend you to my friends. Thank you for a fun, safe and happy time.</q>-LM</p>

		<q>Let me say that the train was wonderful! We went to a party last weekend with a different train company, and it was no where near as nice or fun as yours!</q>-LM</p>

		<q>Kiddie Express far exceeded our expectations in every area of service. Their communication was exceptional, their punctuality and professionalism are above reproach. Kiddie Express&#39; personal attention to our needs and desires, their regard to the safety of our children and outstanding service are both commendable and far above the kind of service that we receive in today&#39;s consumer industry. Julie and JC&#39;s strides to make sure that our experience for our son&#39;s third birthday were special in every way. Our family and friends, tots and adults, feel so fortunate to have been able to celebrate in such a fun and exciting way y&#39;all because of Kiddie Express&#39; exceptional service standards! This is the party entertainment that we should all learn to expect. Thanks for a remarkable and memorable day! You are the best!</q>-MB</p>
